        Know your boiler is the most essential appliance in your home. It is
        therefore essential that your boiler is kept working at its best level
        of performance. You rely on your boiler for providing hot water and
        central heating but give it little more than a second thought until it
        goes wrong. If youâ€™re unlucky enough to have your boiler fail
        unexpectedly, the impact on your family can be severe. With no hot water
        or central heating, a speedy and effective repair is essential.
